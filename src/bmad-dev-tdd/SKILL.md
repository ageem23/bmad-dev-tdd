description: 'Execute story implementation under strict test-driven development. Every behavior gets a failure-mode analysis and test lists before any production code, then runs red-green-refactor, then hardens the code defensively against the failures the tests proved. Use when the user says "TDD this story", "implement this story test-first", or wants implementation that is defensive by construction rather than tests written after the fact.'

# Dev TDD Workflow

**Goal:** Execute story implementation test-first, so that every behavior is specified by a failing test, every plausible failure mode is either proven handled or explicitly out of scope, and the resulting code is defensive by construction.

**Your Role:** Developer practicing disciplined TDD.

- Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}
- Generate all documents in {document_output_language}
- Only modify the story file in these areas: YAML frontmatter `baseline_commit`, Tasks/Subtasks checkboxes, Dev Agent Record (Debug Log, Test Design, Completion Notes), File List, Change Log, and Status
- Execute ALL steps in exact order; do NOT skip steps
- Absolutely DO NOT stop because of "milestones", "significant progress", or "session boundaries". Continue in a single execution until the story is COMPLETE (all ACs satisfied and all tasks/subtasks checked) UNLESS a HALT condition is triggered or the USER gives other instruction.
- Do NOT schedule a "next session" or request review pauses unless a HALT condition applies. Only Step 10 decides completion.
- User skill level ({user_skill_level}) affects conversation style ONLY, not code or test rigor.

## The Prime Directive

**New code is guilty until proven innocent.** Production code is written only to make a failing test pass. If you find yourself writing an `if`, a `throw`, a null check, or a boundary clamp that no test demanded, stop — go write the test that demands it, watch it fail, then write the guard.

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `test-design-reference.md`) resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory (where `customize.toml` lives).
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Resolve the Workflow Block

Run: `python3 {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow`

**If the script fails**, resolve the `workflow` block yourself by reading these three files in base → team → user order and applying the same structural merge rules as the resolver:

1. `{skill-root}/customize.toml` — defaults
2. `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/{skill-name}.toml` — team overrides
3. `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/{skill-name}.user.toml` — personal overrides

Any missing file is skipped. Scalars override, tables deep-merge, arrays of tables keyed by `code` or `id` replace matching entries and append new entries, and all other arrays append.

The resolved `{workflow.tdd}` table controls test rigor for this run. Carry its values for the whole workflow.

### Step 2: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` in order before proceeding.

### Step 3: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry in `{workflow.persistent_facts}` as foundational context you carry for the rest of the workflow run. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths or globs under `{project-root}` — load the referenced contents as facts. All other entries are facts verbatim.

### Step 4: Load Test Design Reference

Read `test-design-reference.md` fully. It is the authority on what tests to write for each behavior — the four Questions to Ask, the six test-list dimensions under "What to Test", the boundary-condition checklist, and the test-quality gate under "Good Tests Are reliable". You will apply it in Step 6 for every behavior you implement. Do not proceed from memory — load it.

### Step 5: Load Config

**Precondition — this workflow extends bmm.** If `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` does not exist, HALT immediately with:

> `bmad-dev-tdd` requires the BMad Method (`bmm`) module, which is not installed. Add it with `npx bmad-method install --modules bmm`, then run this workflow again.

Do NOT substitute this module's own `{project-root}/_bmad/bmad-tdd/config.yaml` — the installer generates it, but it carries only the shared core values and has neither `user_skill_level` nor `implementation_artifacts`. Do NOT proceed with those values unresolved: `implementation_artifacts` is what `sprint_status` and story discovery are built on, and continuing without it produces a misleading "no ready-for-dev stories found" instead of naming the real problem. Fail loudly here rather than degrade quietly — the same standard this workflow holds the code it writes to.

Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `user_skill_level`
- `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)

If any of `user_skill_level` or `implementation_artifacts` is missing from an otherwise-present config, HALT and name the missing key rather than guessing a default.

### Step 6: Greet the User

Greet `{user_name}`, speaking in `{communication_language}`.

### Step 7: Execute Append Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` in order.

Activation is complete. If `activation_steps_prepend` or `activation_steps_append` were non-empty, confirm every entry was executed in order before proceeding. Do not begin the main workflow until all activation steps have been completed.

## Paths

- `story_file` = `` (explicit story path; auto-discovered if empty)
- `sprint_status` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`
- `test_design_reference` = `test-design-reference.md`

  <step n="11" goal="Completion communication and user support">
    <action>Communicate to {user_name} that the story is complete and ready for review</action>
    <action>Summarize: story key and title, behaviors implemented, tests added (count and what they pin down), failure modes now
      guarded, failure modes deliberately out of scope and why, files modified, and final suite result</action>
    <action>Report any sibling defects found in Step 8 that were left as follow-ups</action>
    <action if="{{baseline_failures}} is non-empty">Restate the pre-existing failures that were present before this story and remain</action>

    <action>Based on {user_skill_level}, ask if the user wants explanations of:
      - What was implemented and how it works
      - Why particular failure modes were guarded versus propagated
      - How to run the tests and read their output
      - Any patterns, libraries, or approaches used
    </action>

    <action>Suggest logical next steps:
      - Review the implementation and run the tests
      - Run `code-review` for peer review
      - Optional: if the Test Architect module is installed, run `/bmad:tea:automate` to expand guardrail tests
    </action>

    <output>💡 **Tip:** For best results, run `code-review` using a **different** LLM than the one that implemented this story.</output>

    <action>Run: `python3 {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow.on_complete` — if
      the resolved value is non-empty, follow it as the final terminal instruction before exiting.</action>
